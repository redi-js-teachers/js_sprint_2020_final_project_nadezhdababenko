<h1>Pride and Prejudice</h1>
<h2>By Jane Austen</h2>


<h2>Chapter 1</h2>
    It is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in possession of
    a good fortune, must be in want of a wife.
    </br>
    However little known the feelings or views of such a man may be on his
    first entering a neighbourhood, this truth is so well fixed in the minds
    of the surrounding families, that he is considered the rightful property
    of some one or other of their daughters.
    </br>
    &ldquo;My dear Mr. Bennet,&rdquo; said his lady to him one day, &ldquo;have you heard that
    Netherfield Park is let at last?&rdquo;
    </br>
    Mr. Bennet replied that he had not.
    </br>
    &ldquo;But it is,&rdquo; returned she; &ldquo;for Mrs. Long has just been here, and she told
    me all about it.&rdquo;
    </br>
    Mr. Bennet made no answer.
    </br>
    &ldquo;Do you not want to know who has taken it?&rdquo; cried his wife impatiently.
    </br>
    &ldquo;<i>You</i> want to tell me, and I have no objection to hearing it.&rdquo;
    </br>
    This was invitation enough.
    </br>
    &ldquo;Why, my dear, you must know, Mrs. Long says that Netherfield is taken by
    a young man of large fortune from the north of England; that he came down
    on Monday in a chaise and four to see the place, and was so much delighted
    with it, that he agreed with Mr. Morris immediately; that he is to take
    possession before Michaelmas, and some of his servants are to be in the
    house by the end of next week.&rdquo;
    </br>
    &ldquo;What is his name?&rdquo;
    </br>
    &ldquo;Bingley.&rdquo;
    </br>
    &ldquo;Is he married or single?&rdquo;
    </br>
    &ldquo;Oh! Single, my dear, to be sure! A single man of large fortune; four or
    five thousand a year. What a fine thing for our girls!&rdquo;
    </br>
    &ldquo;How so? How can it affect them?&rdquo;
    </br>
    &ldquo;My dear Mr. Bennet,&rdquo; replied his wife, &ldquo;how can you be so tiresome! You
    must know that I am thinking of his marrying one of them.&rdquo;
    </br>
    &ldquo;Is that his design in settling here?&rdquo;
    </br>
    &ldquo;Design! Nonsense, how can you talk so! But it is very likely that he <i>may</i>
    fall in love with one of them, and therefore you must visit him as soon as
    he comes.&rdquo;
    </br>
    &ldquo;I see no occasion for that. You and the girls may go, or you may send
    them by themselves, which perhaps will be still better, for as you are as
    handsome as any of them, Mr. Bingley may like you the best of the party.&rdquo;
    </br>
    &ldquo;My dear, you flatter me. I certainly <i>have</i> had my share of beauty,
    but I do not pretend to be anything extraordinary now. When a woman has
    five grown-up daughters, she ought to give over thinking of her own
    beauty.&rdquo;
    </br>
    &ldquo;In such cases, a woman has not often much beauty to think of.&rdquo;
    </br>
    &ldquo;But, my dear, you must indeed go and see Mr. Bingley when he comes into
    the neighbourhood.&rdquo;
    </br>
    &ldquo;It is more than I engage for, I assure you.&rdquo;
    </br>
    &ldquo;But consider your daughters. Only think what an establishment it would be
    for one of them. Sir William and Lady Lucas are determined to go, merely
    on that account, for in general, you know, they visit no newcomers. Indeed
    you must go, for it will be impossible for <i>us</i> to visit him if you
    do not.&rdquo;
    </br>
    &ldquo;You are over-scrupulous, surely. I dare say Mr. Bingley will be very glad
    to see you; and I will send a few lines by you to assure him of my hearty
    consent to his marrying whichever he chooses of the girls; though I must
    throw in a good word for my little Lizzy.&rdquo;
    </br>
    &ldquo;I desire you will do no such thing. Lizzy is not a bit better than the
    others; and I am sure she is not half so handsome as Jane, nor half so
    good-humoured as Lydia. But you are always giving <i>her</i> the
    preference.&rdquo;
    </br>
    &ldquo;They have none of them much to recommend them,&rdquo; replied he; &ldquo;they are all
    silly and ignorant like other girls; but Lizzy has something more of
    quickness than her sisters.&rdquo;
    </br>
    &ldquo;Mr. Bennet, how can you abuse your own children in such a way? You
    take delight in vexing me. You have no compassion for my poor nerves.&rdquo;
    </br>
    &ldquo;You mistake me, my dear. I have a high respect for your nerves. They are
    my old friends. I have heard you mention them with consideration these
    last twenty years at least.&rdquo;
    </br>
    &ldquo;Ah, you do not know what I suffer.&rdquo;
    </br>
    &ldquo;But I hope you will get over it, and live to see many young men of four
    thousand a year come into the neighbourhood.&rdquo;
    </br>
    &ldquo;It will be no use to us, if twenty such should come, since you will not
    visit them.&rdquo;
    </br>
    &ldquo;Depend upon it, my dear, that when there are twenty, I will visit them
    all.&rdquo;
    </br>
    Mr. Bennet was so odd a mixture of quick parts, sarcastic humour, reserve,
    and caprice, that the experience of three-and-twenty years had been
    insufficient to make his wife understand his character. <i>Her</i> mind
    was less difficult to develop. She was a woman of mean understanding,
    little information, and uncertain temper. When she was discontented, she
    fancied herself nervous. The business of her life was to get her daughters
    married; its solace was visiting and news.
